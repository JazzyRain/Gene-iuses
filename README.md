# Gene-iuses

## This is our final project for BIOL 432: Computation and Big Data in Biology  

 Data and background knowledge has been taken from Ilska et al.:  
 Ilska, Joanna et al. (2017), Genetic Characterization of Dog Personality Traits, Genetics, Article-journal, https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.116.192674 
 
 The following files are attached:  
 
 archive - Genotype files in binary Plink format and phenotypic trait data from Ilska et al.  
 
 Question 1.html - Is neutering/sex status correlated with any personality traits? (Alex Tsiofas)   
 Question 1.Rmd  
 Question 2.html - Is age correlated with an increase/decrease in certain traits? (Jordan Rutherford)  
 Question 2.Rmd  
 Question 3.Rmd - Which factors are most predictive of trainability, non-owner-directed aggression, agitation when ignored, attention seeking (Damian Bourne/Zach Lehman)  
 Question_3_Figures - Figures from Question 3 (Damian Bourne/Zach Lehman)  
 Question 4b.Rmd - Are SNPs in genes correlated with behavioural traits indicative of evolutionary relationships?   
 Alignment.R -  Use cytochrome oxidase I gene to create a evolutionarily accurate phylogenetic tree (Rain Zhu/Zach Lehman)  
 -- Canis lupus familiaris CADPS2, TH and DRD4 gene trees (Alex Tsiofas)  
 -- Are the binary encoded behavioural traits indicative of any patterns across dogs in the study? (Janis Cheng)  
 
 all_traits_1975dogs_dyrad.xlsx - encoded traits of 1975 Labrador Retrievers from Ilska et al.  
 conversion.sh - Bash file converting .xlsx file into .csv file and renaming it as "traits.csv"  
 traits.csv - Encoded traits from Ilska et al. after conversion
